Repository for learning python from Datacamp.

## Notes Section
*Quarto & Python Integration*
- Although the files themselves are python files, I'm creating them in VS Code, and rending them using Quarto, rather than Jupyter Notebooks. When rendering a python document using quarto, quarto defaults to [not executing code cells](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html#cell-execution). 


## Troubleshooting 
- July 10,2022: Had to install matplot lib through the terminal using `python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib` in order to use the module with the latest version of python.
